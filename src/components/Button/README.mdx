## Button Guidelines

### Primary

- Purpose: The main call-to-action (CTA) on a page.
- Use Cases:
  - Submitting forms.
  - Proceeding to the next step in a flow.
- Best Practices:
  - Use only one primary button per page to avoid confusion.
  - Ensure it is visually distinct from secondary buttons.

### Secondary

- Purpose: Alternative actions that are not the primary focus but still important.
- Use Cases:
  - "Cancel" or "Back" actions.
  - Supporting actions near the primary button.
- Best Practices:
  - Use in conjunction with a primary button, ensuring it is less visually prominent.
  - Avoid using secondary buttons as standalone CTAs.

### Outline

- Purpose: For less prominent actions, often contextual.
- Use Cases:
  - Actions where users need additional context (e.g., "Learn More").
  - Lightweight options compared to primary/secondary buttons.
- Best Practices:
  - Use only when the action is not critical.
  -Ensure enough contrast between the button and the background for readability.

### Text

- Purpose: Minimalist actions that are typically inline or lightweight.
- Use Cases:
  - Non-intrusive actions like "Skip" or "View Details."
  - Actions embedded in a paragraph or other UI elements.
- Best Practices:
  - Avoid overusing text buttons as they are less visually prominent.
  - Always ensure proper contrast with the background.

### Error

- Purpose: Draws attention to critical or destructive actions.
- Use Cases:
  - Deleting accounts or items.
  - Confirming irreversible operations.
- Best Practices:
  - Use sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user.
  - Always pair with confirmation dialogs or warnings for clarity.
  - Make it visually distinct from other button types.
